Experiment with the write() method by creating a file, writing to the file, and appending to the file.

Do not forget to close the file handle as soon as you are done with working on it.

Try drawing concentric circles.

You can use turtle.circle(200, 270) to draw an arc of 270 degrees, with radius 200.

You can also draw circles clockwise using a negative radius parameter such as turtle.circle(-150, 300).

If you need to draw a hexagon, you can use turtle.circle(200, 360, 6).
