## Question 1: Chatbot

#Chatbot: Hello there! I’m the CS101 Study Bot. What’s your name?
#User: Ayse
#Chatbot: Great to meet you, Ayse! How many semesters have you been studying Computer Science?
#User: 2
#Chatbot: Ah, “2” semesters, nice! I’m still learning myself. What are you working on right now?
#User: Learning about algorithms.
#Chatbot: “Algorithms”, huh? That’s a challenging topic! I can’t say I know all the algorithms yet, but maybe we can figure it out together? Need help with something specific?
#User: Can you explain sorting algorithms?
#Chatbot: I wish I could, but I’m just a simple chatbot for now. Maybe check out the lecture notes or ask your instructor for more details. I’m here for small talk though! Anything else?
#User: Tell me more about you.
#Chatbot: Well, I was programmed by “Ayse” in a few lines of code for CS101. My job is to chat and keep you company while you study. Have fun with your course, and let’s talk again soon!





## Question 2: 

# You are expected to display each one of the following messages on a new line
# "Cmpe150 requires regular practice"
# "The more I study, the easier it will become"
#
# After these two messages, you should define a function calculate_f to calculate
# and display the result of f = m * a for the given m and a arguments.
# Then you should define getWidth function to return the width of a triangle as explained
# in the question description


# DO_NOT_EDIT_ANYTHING_ABOVE_THIS_LINE



# DO_NOT_EDIT_ANYTHING_BELOW_THIS_LINE

m = int(input())
a = int(input())
calculate_f(m, a)

triangle_height = int(input())
triangle_width = getWidth(triangle_height)
print(triangle_width)
