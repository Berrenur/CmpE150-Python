## Q2

# You are expected to display each one of the following messages on a new line
# "Cmpe150 requires regular practice"
# "The more I study, the easier it will become"
#
# After these two messages, you should define a function calculate_f to calculate
# and display the result of f = m * a for the given m and a arguments.
# Then you should define getWidth function to return the width of a triangle as explained
# in the question description


# DO_NOT_EDIT_ANYTHING_ABOVE_THIS_LINE

print("Cmpe150 requires regular practice.")
print("The more I study, the easier it will become.")

    return 2 * height - 1
