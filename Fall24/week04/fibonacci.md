Fibonacci numbers are defined as the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers:

f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for 𝑛 ≥ 2

The first 8 Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

Write a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

Report the outputs with n = 11, 15, 18, 21, 30
