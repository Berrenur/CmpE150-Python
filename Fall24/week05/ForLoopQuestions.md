## Question 1

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.

<br>

## Question 2

Write a function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

<br>

## Question 3

Write a function that takes a list and returns the largest number.

<br>

## Question 4

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

<br>

## Question 5

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns two new lists: one containing only the even numbers and the other containing only the odd numbers.

<br>

## Question 6

Define a function cumulative_sum that takes a list of numbers and returns a list where each element is the cumulative sum up to that index.

Example: cumulative_sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return [1, 3, 6, 10].

<br>

## Question 7

Write a function print_number_pattern that takes an integer n and prints a number pattern where each row i contains numbers from 1 to i. For example, if n is 5, the pattern should look like this:

1

1 2

1 2 3

1 2 3 4

1 2 3 4 5

## Question 8: Digital Clock Simulation

Write a program that simulates a digital clock counting seconds, starting from 00:00:00 (HH: MM) up to a user-defined time limit in seconds. Use nested for loops for hours, minutes, and seconds up to the specified limit.

Input:
An integer seconds_limit representing how long the clock should run.

Output:
Print each second in HH:MM format, simulating the passage of time.

For seconds_limit = 5, the output should be:

00:00:00

00:00:01

00:00:02

00:00:03

00:00:04

00:00:05

## Question 9: Pascal's Triangle

Write a program that prints Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows, n. Pascal's Triangle is a triangle of numbers where each row represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion.

Each number in a row is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. Use nested for loops to generate each row based on the previous row.

For n = 4:

       1

      1 1

     1 2 1

    1 3 3 1

## Question 10: Checkerboard Pattern

Write a program that prints an n x n checkerboard pattern with alternating X and O characters. Use nested for loops and conditionals to alternate between X and O based on the row and column indices.

Input:
An integer n (size of the board).

Output:
A checkerboard pattern of size n, alternating between X and O in a grid.

For n = 5, the output should be:

X O X O X

O X O X O

X O X O X

O X O X O

X O X O X
