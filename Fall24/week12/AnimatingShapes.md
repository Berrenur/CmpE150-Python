## Question 1 - Moving Point Animation
Write a function animate_point that animates a point moving along the x-axis in a 2D plot. The x-coordinates should range from 0 to 10, and the y-coordinate should remain constant at 5 throughout the animation. Ensure the point moves smoothly across the screen.


<br>

## Question 2 - Oscillating Sine Wave
Write a function oscillating_wave that animates a sine wave oscillating vertically. The x-coordinates should range from 0 to 2π, and the wave should oscillate up and down over time.


<br>

## Question 3 - Bouncing Ball in a Box
Write a function bouncing_ball that simulates a ball bouncing inside a 2D box of size 10×10. The ball should reflect off the walls (left, right, top, and bottom) when it hits them and continue bouncing inside the box.


<br>

## Question 4 - Circular Orbit Simulation
Write a function circular_orbit that simulates two points orbiting a central point in circular paths. One point should have a radius of 1 and the other a radius of 2. Both points should orbit the center simultaneously, each moving at different speeds.


<br>

## Question 5 - Complex Ball Animation
Write a function ball_following_wave that simulates a ball following a sine wave while also bouncing vertically. The ball should move horizontally along the sine wave and bounce vertically. Provide two versions of the solution.

<br>

## Question 6 - Animation of Multiple Moving Points
Write a function animate_multiple_points that animates multiple points moving along the x-axis. Each point should have its own speed, and the points should be distinguished by different colors. The points should move in parallel but at different rates.


<br>

## Question 7 - Bouncing Ball with Gravity
Write a function bouncing_ball_gravity that simulates a ball bouncing inside a 10×10 box with gravity applied. The ball should start at a random position within the box (not on the edges) and should accelerate downward due to gravity. It should bounce off the floor with energy loss each time it hits the floor. The ball's speed should increase as it falls, and it should slow down when moving upward. The ball should maintain realistic physics, with gravity causing the ball to accelerate downward and decelerate when moving upward. The ball should also bounce off the walls (left, right, top) and never go outside the box.


<br>

## Question 8 - Pendulum Simulation
Write a function pendulum_simulation that simulates a simple pendulum. The pendulum should swing back and forth, and its motion should be based on simple harmonic motion principles. The pendulum should eventually stop after a few oscillations due to damping (energy loss).

<br>

## Question 9 - Color Changing Sine Wave
Write a function color_changing_sine_wave that animates a sine wave whose color changes dynamically as the wave oscillates. The wave's color should transition smoothly from one color to another over time.


<br>

## Question 10 - Expanding Circle
Write a function expanding_circle that animates a circle whose radius increases over time. The circle should start small and expand while remaining centered on the screen. The expansion should stop once the circle hits the border of the box, and the animation should end.
