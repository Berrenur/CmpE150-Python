| Category                              | BMI     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Very severely underweight             | -15     |
| Severely underweight                  | 15-16   |
| Underweight                           | 16-18.5 |
| Normal (healthy weight)               | 18.5-25 |

## Question 10

Write a program which takes three floats as **a, b, c** and calculates **real roots** for a quadratic equation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large ax^{2} %2B bx %2B c"> using the formula <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large x = -b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac} /2a ">

The expression under the square root is known as **the discriminant.** 

* If the discriminant is **negative**, the roots are **imaginary.** 
* If the discriminant is **zero**, there is **only one root.** 
* If the discriminant is **positive**, there are **two roots.**

*Note: Ignore imaginary roots.*

| Input  | Output    |
