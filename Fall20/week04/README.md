## Question 5 - Sum Facts

Write a program which takes an integer as input and computes the sum of the factorial of each digit.  For example, assume that the user enters 572 as the input. For each digit of the integer, you will compute the factorial. Then you will compute the sum of these factorials: 5! + 7! + 2! = 120 + 5040 + 2 = 5162.
