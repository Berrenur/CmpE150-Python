| 135 | 3 0 |



## Question 9 - Positive Mental Attitude

Write a program that will take integers as inputs until the user enters a negative number. Then shows the user the sum of all ODD non-negative numbers that is entered.

|  INPUT  |  OUTPUT |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| 4 7 45 9 2 0 0 5 8 -4  | 66 |
| 1 1 0 1 -1 | 3 |


## Question 10 - Guess

Generate a random number between 1 and 100 (including 1 and 100). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. Also print the number of tries.


| Input | Output          |
| ----- | --------------- |
| 35<br>67<br>73<br>71 | Too low!<br>Too low!<br>Too high!<br>You got it!<br>And it only took you 4 tries! |


## Question 11 - NoBig

Write a program that reads numbers until the entered number is greater than the previous entered number. Then print the average of all entered numbers except the last one. (At least two numbers will be entered)

|  INPUT  |  OUTPUT |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| 5 4 3 3 8 | 3.75 |
| 1 2 | 1.0 |
| 100 54 46 2 3 | 53.0 |


## Question 12 - FizzBuzz
Take an integer N from the user as an input. And then print all the numbers from 1 to N (inclusive), but if a number is a multiple of 2, print "Fizz",
if a number is a multiple of 3, print "Buzz", and if a number is a multiple of 6 print "FizzBuzz".

| Input | Output                               |
| :---: | ------------------------------------ |
|  6  | 1 Fizz Buzz Fizz 5 FizzBuzz |

## Question 13

Write a program that takes two nonnegative integers as input and finds their greatest common divisor.

13 91 -> 13<br>
87 15 -> 3<br>
432 0 -> 0<br>
18 18 -> 18<br>


## Question 14

A number is said to be "Disarium" if the sum of its digits raised to their respective positions is the number itself.
Write a program that determines whether a number is a Disarium or not.

75 ➞ False

<em> 7^1 + 5^2 = 7 + 25 = 32</em>
 
135 ➞ True

<em> 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135</em>
 
Example Inputs/Outputs:<br>

544 ➞ False <br>
 
518 ➞ True <br>
 
466 ➞ False <br>
 
8 ➞ True <br>
